I have implemented this assessment with Cucumber framework as required.

This framework could be improved by converting the Cucumber framework to TestNG as I could benefit from the various TestNG
annotations for better test running options management while also maintaining the BDD advantage.
I could also have implemented the TessNGextentReport to create an HTML reporting for the text execution.

Also, logging could be implemented using log4j libraries for quick error/failure debugging and also to share execution report
to teams.

I created the project using maven to allow for dependencies uniqueness for the project and also to make project suitable for continuous
integration with jenkins pipeline.
 
 Meanwhile, I could have improved my code structure to make it more reusable by creating methods for some functions used and also avoid
 boiler plate as much as possible. Also, this could be improved by creating more PageLocators.java file to hold multiple' single page objects but 
 starved of time as I had personal issues that prevented me from starting this earlier.
 
 Running the project is from TestRunner.java as junit.
